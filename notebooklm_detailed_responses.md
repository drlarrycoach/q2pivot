| **Milton & Janet Bennett** | "Respectfully acknowledging difference in preference or belief... is the foundation of attributing equal humanity to others." | "Respectfully acknowledging difference in preference or belief... is the foundation of attributing equal humanity to others." <br><br> The Architecture of Empathy <br> If we must distill our life’s work—from the peace corps in Micronesia to the founding of the Intercultural Communication Institute—it is contained in the shift from the Golden Rule to the Platinum Rule. <br> For too long, well-meaning people and organizations have been trapped in Minimization (Stage 3 of the DMIS). They operate on the Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. While comfortable, this is actually a refusal to see the other; it assumes that deep down, everyone is just like you. It is a "colonization" of the other's experience. <br> Our mission has been to scaffold the difficult developmental climb toward Adaptation, where we embrace the Platinum Rule: Treat others as they would have you do unto them. <br> This is the ultimate act of caring and humanity. It requires that you overcome the "assumption of similarity" and engage in the rigorous, often exhausting work of empathy—imaginatively participating in another person's worldview rather than just projecting your own feelings onto them. Only when we stop pretending we are all the same can we truly coordinate meaning and action to survive as a global species. |
